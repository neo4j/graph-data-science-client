    "The new Project 🍓 (Strawberry) is a new way to run GDS on data hosted in an AuraDB database.\n",
    "The way to do this currently in Aura is to copy the database over to an AuraDS instance, which is itself a database service (single instance).\n",

    "- It's very manual; users have to click in the Aura Console to copy the database\n",
    "- Once GDS computations are finished, writing back to the AuraDB instance is also a manual configuration\n",
    "- AuraDS instances have to be manually managed in the Aura Console and do not encourage users to delete them after usage, thus causing increased running costs\n",
