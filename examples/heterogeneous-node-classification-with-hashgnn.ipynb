    "As the last part of the training pipeline, there will be an ML training algorithm.\n",

    "Its name comes from the fact that the algorithm design is inspired by that of graph neural networks, in that it does message passing interleaved with transformations on each node.\n",
    "But instead of doing neural transformations like most GNNs, its transformations are done by locality sensitive min-hashing.\n",
    "Since the hash functions used are randomly chosen independent of the input data, there is no need for training. \n",

    "We will give hashGNN the `plot_keywords` node properties as input, and it will output new feature vectors for each node that has been enriched by message passing over relationships.\n",
