        Runs the longest path algorithm in a DAG and returns the result as a DataFrame.

        Parameters
        ----------
        G
           Graph object to use
        relationship_weight_property
            Name of the property to be used as weights.
        relationship_types
            Filter the graph using the given relationship types. Relationships with any of the given types will be included.
        node_labels
            Filter the graph using the given node labels. Nodes with any of the given labels will be included.
        sudo
            Disable the memory guard.
        log_progress
            Display progress logging.
        username
            As an administrator, impersonate a different user for accessing their graphs.
        concurrency
            Number of concurrent threads to use.
        job_id
            Identifier for the computation.

        Returns
        -------
        DataFrame
            The longest path results as a DataFrame with columns for index, sourceNode, targetNode, totalCost, nodeIds, costs.
