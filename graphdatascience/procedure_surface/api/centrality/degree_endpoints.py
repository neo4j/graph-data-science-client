        Runs the Degree Centrality algorithm and stores the results in the graph catalog as a new node property.

        The Degree Centrality algorithm can be used to find popular nodes within a graph.
        The degree centrality measures the number of incoming or outgoing (or both) relationships from a node, which can be defined by the orientation of a relationship projection.
        It can be applied to either weighted or unweighted graphs.
        In the weighted case the algorithm computes the sum of all positive weights of adjacent relationships of a node, for each node in the graph.

            'NATURAL' (default) respects the direction of relationships as they are stored in the graph.
            'REVERSE' treats each relationship as if it were directed in the opposite direction.
            'UNDIRECTED' treats all relationships as undirected, effectively counting both directions.
        relationship_types : list[str] | None, default=None
            The relationship types used to select relationships for this algorithm run.
        node_labels : list[str] | None, default=None
            The node labels used to select nodes for this algorithm run.
        sudo : bool | None, default=None
            Override memory estimation limits. Use with caution as this can lead to
            memory issues if the estimation is significantly wrong.
        log_progress : bool | None, default=None
            Whether to log progress of the algorithm execution

        relationship_weight_property : str | None, default=None
            The property name that contains relationship weights. If specified,
