        Runs the Harmonic Centrality algorithm and stores the results in the graph catalog as a new node property.

        Harmonic centrality (also known as valued centrality) is a variant of closeness centrality, that was invented to
        solve the problem the original formula had when dealing with unconnected graphs.

        Parameters
        ----------
        G : GraphV2
            The graph to run the algorithm on
        mutate_property : str
            The property name to store the harmonic closeness centrality score for each node
        relationship_types : list[str] | None, default=None
            The relationship types used to select relationships for this algorithm run.
        node_labels : list[str] | None, default=None
            The node labels used to select nodes for this algorithm run.
        sudo : bool | None, default=None
            Override memory estimation limits. Use with caution as this can lead to
            memory issues if the estimation is significantly wrong.
        log_progress : bool | None, default=None
            Whether to log progress of the algorithm execution
        username : str | None, default=None
            The username to attribute the procedure run to
        concurrency : Any | None, default=None
            The number of concurrent threads used for the algorithm execution.
        job_id : Any | None, default=None
            An identifier for the job that can be used for monitoring and cancellation

        Runs the Harmonic Centrality algorithm and returns result statistics without storing the results.

        Harmonic centrality was proposed by Marchiori and Latora while trying to come up with a sensible notion of "average shortest path".

        Rather than summing the distances of a node to all other nodes, the harmonic centrality algorithm sums the inverse of those distances.
