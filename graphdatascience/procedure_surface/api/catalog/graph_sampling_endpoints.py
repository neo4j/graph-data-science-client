        Random walk with restarts (RWR) samples the graph by taking random walks from a set of start nodes.

        On each step of a random walk, there is a probability that the walk stops, and a new walk from one of the start
        nodes starts instead (i.e. the walk restarts). Each node visited on these walks will be part of the sampled
        subgraph. The resulting subgraph is stored as a new graph in the Graph Catalog.

        Parameters
        ----------
        G : GraphV2
            The input graph to be sampled.
        graph_name : str
            The name of the new graph that is stored in the graph catalog.
        start_nodes : list of int, optional
            IDs of the initial set of nodes in the original graph from which the sampling random walks will start.
            By default, a single node is chosen uniformly at random.
        restart_probability : float, optional
            The probability that a sampling random walk restarts from one of the start nodes.
            Default is 0.1.
        sampling_ratio : float, optional
            The fraction of nodes in the original graph to be sampled.
            Default is 0.15.
        node_label_stratification : bool, optional
            If true, preserves the node label distribution of the original graph.
            Default is False.
        relationship_weight_property : str, optional
            Name of the relationship property to use as weights. If unspecified, the algorithm runs unweighted.
        relationship_types : list of str, optional
            Filter the named graph using the given relationship types. Relationships with any of the given types will be
            included.
        node_labels : list of str, optional
            Filter the named graph using the given node labels. Nodes with any of the given labels will be included.
        sudo : bool, optional
            Bypass heap control. Use with caution.
            Default is False.
        log_progress : bool, optional
            Turn `on/off` percentage logging while running procedure.
            Default is True.
        username : str, optional
            Use Administrator access to run an algorithm on a graph owned by another user.
            Default is None.
        concurrency : int, optional
            The number of concurrent threads used for running the algorithm.
            Default is 4.
        job_id : str, optional
            An ID that can be provided to more easily track the algorithm’s progress.
            By default, a random job id is generated.

        Common Neighbour Aware Random Walk (CNARW) samples the graph by taking random walks from a set of start nodes

        CNARW is a graph sampling technique that involves optimizing the selection of the next-hop node. It takes into
        account the number of common neighbours between the current node and the next-hop candidates. On each step of a
        random walk, there is a probability that the walk stops, and a new walk from one of the start nodes starts
        instead (i.e. the walk restarts). Each node visited on these walks will be part of the sampled subgraph. The
        resulting subgraph is stored as a new graph in the Graph Catalog.
