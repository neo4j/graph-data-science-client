= Mapping to Cypher API

There are some general principles for how the Cypher API maps to the Python client API:

* Method calls corresponding to Cypher procedures (preceded by `CALL` in the docs) return:
+
--
* A table as a pandas `DataFrame`, if the procedure returns several rows (eg. stream mode algorithm calls).
* A row as a pandas `Series`, if the procedure returns exactly one row (eg. stats mode algorithm calls).
--
+
Some notable exceptions to this are:

** Procedures instantiating xref:graph-object.adoc[graph objects] and xref:model-object.adoc[model objects] have two return values: a graph or model object, and a row of metadata (typically a pandas `Series`) from the underlying procedure call.
** Any methods on xref:pipelines.adoc[pipeline], xref:graph-object.adoc[graph] or xref:model-object.adoc[model] objects (native to the Python client) mapping to Cypher procedures.
** `gds.version()` which returns a string.
* Method calls corresponding to Cypher functions (preceded by `RETURN` in the docs) will simply return the value the function returns.
* The Python client also contains specific functionality for inspecting graphs from the https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/management-ops/graph-catalog-ops/[GDS Graph Catalog], using a client-side xref:graph-object.adoc[graph object].
Similarly, models from the https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/model-catalog/[GDS Model Catalog] can be inspected using a client-side xref:model-object.adoc[model object].
* Cypher functions and procedures of GDS that take references to graphs and/or models as strings for input typically instead take xref:graph-object.adoc[graph objects] and/or xref:model-object.adoc[model objects] as input in the Python client API.
* To configure and use https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/machine-learning/machine-learning/[machine learning pipelines] in GDS, specific xref:pipelines.adoc[pipeline objects] are used in the Python client.
