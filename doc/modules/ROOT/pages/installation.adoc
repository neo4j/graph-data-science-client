== System requirements

The GDS Python client depends on Python, the Neo4j Python Driver, and a server-side installation of the GDS library (see https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/installation/[installation instruction for the GDS library]).
The Python client supports the following versions of the other three components:

== Versioning

To make things easy for users of the Python client, our aim is that running `pip install --upgrade graphdatascience` should give you a version of the client that supports all https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/installation/supported-neo4j-versions/[currently supported GDS library versions], starting with 2.0.

The Python client follows https://semver.org/[semantic versioning].

Python client versions do not map identically to versions of the GDS library.
Eg. Python client version X.Y must not necessarily be compatible with GDS library version X.Y.
Instead, the Python client may be released independently and one has to consult xref:installation.adoc#python-client-system-requirements[System requirements] above to figure out whether one's client version is compatible with the GDS library on the server.


== Optional dependencies

Some functionality of the `graphdatascience` library requires extra dependencies.
These dependencies are not installed by default since

* They may be somewhat sizeable, and the functionality they enable is not necessarily something every user of the library needs, or
* They may require additional system specific installation steps in addition to `pip install`.

Instructions on how to install these extra dependencies and what they enable is outlined in this section.


=== Neo4j python driver speedup extension

The `graphdatascience` library utilizes the Neo4j Python Driver under the hood to communicate with Neo4j DBMSs.
In order to enable the driver speedup given by the https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j-python-driver-rust-ext[Neo4j python driver rust extension], one has to install the optional `rust_ext` dependency:

[source,bash]
----
pip install graphdatascience[rust_ext]
----

Though unlikely, depending on your system, additional steps may be required.
If this is the case, those steps are outlined in the https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j-python-driver-rust-ext?tab=readme-ov-file#requirements[Neo4j python driver rust extension README].


=== OGB dataset loading

In order to use the xref:common-datasets#ogb[convenience OGB dataset loading functionality] of `graphdatascience`, one has to install the optional `ogb` dependency:

[source,bash]
----
pip install graphdatascience[ogb]
----


=== NetworkX graph loading

In order to use the xref:graph-object#networkx[convenience NetworkX graph loading functionality] of `graphdatascience`, one has to install the optional `networkx` dependency:

[source,bash]
----
pip install graphdatascience[networkx]
----
