= FastRP and kNN end-to-end example

This notebook exemplifies how to use the `graphdatascience` Python
library to operate Neo4j GDS. It shows an adapted version of the FastRP
and kNN end-to-end example from the GDS Manual, found
https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/end-to-end-examples/fastrp-knn-example[here].

We consider a graph of products and customers, and we want to find new
products to recommend for each customer. We want to use
https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/algorithms/knn/[the
K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm (kNN)] to identify similar customers and
base our product recommendations on that. In order to be able to
leverage topological information about the graph in kNN, we will first
create node embeddings using
https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/machine-learning/node-embeddings/fastrp/[FastRP].
These embeddings will be the input to the kNN algorithm.

We will then use a Cypher query to generate recommendations for each
pair of similar customers, where products that have been purchased by
one of the customers will be recommended to the other.

== Prerequisites

Running this notebook requires a Neo4j server with a recent version
(2.0+) of GDS installed. We recommend using Neo4j Desktop with GDS, or
AuraDS.

The `graphdatascience` Python library needs to be installed as well. See
the examples in the Setup section below and in the
https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science-client/current/installation/[client
installation instructions].

== Setup

We start by installing and importing our dependencies, and setting up
our GDS client connection to the database.

[source, python]
----
# Install necessary dependencies
%pip graphdatascience
----

[source, python]
----
from graphdatascience import GraphDataScience

# Override NEO4J_URI and NEO4J_AUTH here according to your setup
NEO4J_URI = "bolt://localhost:7687"
NEO4J_AUTH = None
gds = GraphDataScience(NEO4J_URI, auth=NEO4J_AUTH)
----

== Example graph creation

We now create a graph of products and customers in the database. The
`amount` relationship property represents the average weekly amount of
money spent by a customer on a given product.

[source, python]
----
# The `run_cypher` method can be used to run arbitrary Cypher queries on the database.
_ = gds.run_cypher(
    """
        CREATE
         (dan:Person {name: 'Dan'}),
         (annie:Person {name: 'Annie'}),
         (matt:Person {name: 'Matt'}),
         (jeff:Person {name: 'Jeff'}),
         (brie:Person {name: 'Brie'}),
         (elsa:Person {name: 'Elsa'}),

         (cookies:Product {name: 'Cookies'}),
         (tomatoes:Product {name: 'Tomatoes'}),
         (cucumber:Product {name: 'Cucumber'}),
         (celery:Product {name: 'Celery'}),
         (kale:Product {name: 'Kale'}),
         (milk:Product {name: 'Milk'}),
         (chocolate:Product {name: 'Chocolate'}),

         (dan)-[:BUYS {amount: 1.2}]->(cookies),
         (dan)-[:BUYS {amount: 3.2}]->(milk),
         (dan)-[:BUYS {amount: 2.2}]->(chocolate),

         (annie)-[:BUYS {amount: 1.2}]->(cucumber),
         (annie)-[:BUYS {amount: 3.2}]->(milk),
         (annie)-[:BUYS {amount: 3.2}]->(tomatoes),

         (matt)-[:BUYS {amount: 3}]->(tomatoes),
         (matt)-[:BUYS {amount: 2}]->(kale),
         (matt)-[:BUYS {amount: 1}]->(cucumber),

         (jeff)-[:BUYS {amount: 3}]->(cookies),
         (jeff)-[:BUYS {amount: 2}]->(milk),

         (brie)-[:BUYS {amount: 1}]->(tomatoes),
         (brie)-[:BUYS {amount: 2}]->(milk),
         (brie)-[:BUYS {amount: 2}]->(kale),
         (brie)-[:BUYS {amount: 3}]->(cucumber),
         (brie)-[:BUYS {amount: 0.3}]->(celery),

         (elsa)-[:BUYS {amount: 3}]->(chocolate),
         (elsa)-[:BUYS {amount: 3}]->(milk)
    """
)

== Projecting into GDS

In order to be able to analyze the data in our database, we proceed to
projecting it into memory where GDS can operate on it.

[source, python]
----
# We define how we want to project our database into GDS
node_projection = ["Person", "Product"]
relationship_projection = {"BUYS": {"orientation": "UNDIRECTED", "properties": "amount"}}

# Before actually going through with the projection, let's check how much memory is required
result = gds.graph.project.estimate(node_projection, relationship_projection)

print(f"Required memory for native loading: {result['requiredMemory']}")
----

[source, python]
----
# For this small graph memory requirement is low. Let us go through with the projection
G, result = gds.graph.project("purchases", node_projection, relationship_projection)

print(f"The projection took {result['projectMillis']} ms")

# We can use convenience methods on `G` to check if the projection looks correct
print(f"Graph '{G.name()}' node count: {G.node_count()}")
print(f"Graph '{G.name()}' node labels: {G.node_labels()}")
----

== Creating FastRP node embeddings

Next we use the
https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/machine-learning/node-embeddings/fastrp/[FastRP
algorithm] to generate node embeddings that capture topological
information from the graph. We choose to work with `embeddingDimension`
set to 4 which is sufficient since our example graph is very small. The
`iterationWeights` are chosen empirically to yield sensible results.
Please see
https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/machine-learning/node-embeddings/fastrp/#algorithms-embeddings-fastrp-syntax[the
syntax section of the FastRP documentation] for more information on
these parameters.

Since we want to use the embeddings as input when we run kNN later we
use FastRP’s mutate mode.

[source, python]
----
# We can also estimate memory of running algorithms like FastRP, so let's do that first
result = gds.fastRP.mutate.estimate(
    G,
    mutateProperty="embedding",
    randomSeed=42,
    embeddingDimension=4,
    relationshipWeightProperty="amount",
    iterationWeights=[0.8, 1, 1, 1],
)

print(f"Required memory for running FastRP: {result['requiredMemory']}")
----

[source, python]
----
# Now let's run FastRP and mutate our projected graph 'purchases' with the results
result = gds.fastRP.mutate(
    G,
    mutateProperty="embedding",
    randomSeed=42,
    embeddingDimension=4,
    relationshipWeightProperty="amount",
    iterationWeights=[0.8, 1, 1, 1],
)

# Let's make sure we got an embedding for each node
print(f"Number of embedding vectors produced: {result['nodePropertiesWritten']}")
----

== Similarities with kNN

Now we can run
https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/algorithms/knn/[kNN]
to identify similar nodes by using the node embeddings that we generated
with FastRP as `nodeProperties`. Since we are working with a small
graph, we can set `sampleRate` to 1 and `deltaThreshold` to 0 without
having to worry about long computation times. The `concurrency`
parameter is set to 1 (along with the fixed `randomSeed`) in order to
get a deterministic result. Please see
https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/algorithms/knn/#algorithms-knn-syntax[the
syntax section of the kNN documentation] for more information on these
parameters.

Note that we will use the algorithm’s write mode to write the properties
and relationships back to our database, so that we can analyze them
later using Cypher.

[source, python]
----
# Run kNN and write back to db (we skip memory estimation this time...)
result = gds.knn.write(
    G,
    topK=2,
    nodeProperties=["embedding"],
    randomSeed=42,
    concurrency=1,
    sampleRate=1.0,
    deltaThreshold=0.0,
    writeRelationshipType="SIMILAR",
    writeProperty="score",
)

print(f"Relationships produced: {result['relationshipsWritten']}")
print(f"Nodes compared: {result['nodesCompared']}")
print(f"Mean similarity: {result['similarityDistribution']['mean']}")
----

As we can see the mean similarity between nodes is quite high. This is
due to the fact that we have a small example where there are no long
paths between nodes leading to many similar FastRP node embeddings.

== Exploring the results

Let us now inspect the results of our kNN call by using Cypher. We can
use the `SIMILARITY` relationship type to filter out the relationships
we are interested in. And since we just care about similarities between
people for our product recommendation engine, we make sure to only match
nodes with the `Person` label.

Please see https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/[the Cypher
manual] for documentation on how to use Cypher.

[source, python]
----
gds.run_cypher(
    """
        MATCH (p1:Person)-[r:SIMILAR]->(p2:Person)
        RETURN p1.name AS person1, p2.name AS person2, r.score AS similarity
        ORDER BY similarity DESCENDING, person1, person2
    """
)
----

Our kNN results indicate among other things that the `Person` nodes
named ``Annie'' and ``Matt'' are very similar. Looking at the `BUYS`
relationships for these two nodes we can see that such a conclusion
makes sense. They both buy three products, two of which are the same
(`Product` nodes named ``Cucumber'' and ``Tomatoes'') for both people
and with similar amounts. We can therefore have high confidence in our
approach.

== Making recommendations

Using the information we derived that the `Person` nodes named ``Annie''
and ``Matt'' are similar, we can make product recommendations for each
of them. Since they are similar, we can assume that products purchased
by only one of the people may be of interest to buy also for the other
person not already buying the product. By this principle we can derive
product recommendations for the `Person` named ``Matt'' using a simple
Cypher query.

[source, python]
----
gds.run_cypher(
    """
        MATCH (:Person {name: "Annie"})-[:BUYS]->(p1:Product)
        WITH collect(p1) as products
        MATCH (:Person {name: "Matt"})-[:BUYS]->(p2:Product)
        WHERE not p2 in products
        RETURN p2.name as recommendation
    """
)
----

Indeed, ``Kale'' is the one product that the Person named ``Annie'' buys
that is also not purchased by the Person named ``Matt''.

== Cleaning up

Before finishing we can clean up the example data from both the GDS
in-memory state and the database.

[source, python]
----
# Remove our projection from the GDS graph catalog
G.drop()

# Remove all the example data from the database
_ = gds.run_cypher("MATCH (n) DETACH DELETE n")
----

== Conclusion

Using two GDS algorithms and some basic Cypher we were easily able to
derive some sensible product recommendations for a customer in our small
example.

To make sure to get similarities to other customers for every customer
in our graph with kNN, we could play around with increasing the `topK`
parameter.
