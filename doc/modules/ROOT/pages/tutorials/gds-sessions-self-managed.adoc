This Jupyter notebook is hosted
https://github.com/neo4j/graph-data-science-client/blob/main/examples/gds-sessions-self-managed.ipynb[here]
in the Neo4j Graph Data Science Client Github repository.

The notebook shows how to use the `graphdatascience` Python library to
create, manage, and use a GDS Session.

We consider a graph of people and fruits, which we’re using as a simple
example to show how to connect your self-managed Neo4j database to a GDS
Session, run algorithms, and eventually write back your analytical
results to your Neo4j database. We will cover all management operations:
creation, listing, and deletion.

If you are using AuraDB, follow link:../gds-sessions[this example].

== Prerequisites

This notebook requires having a Neo4j instance instance available and
that the GDS sessions feature is enabled for your Neo4j Aura tenant.
Contact your account manager to get the features enabled.

We also need to have the `graphdatascience` Python library installed,
version `1.12a1` or later.

[source, python, role=no-test]
----
%pip install "graphdatascience>=1.13"
----

== Aura API credentials

A GDS Session is managed via the Aura API. In order to use the Aura API,
we need to have
https://neo4j.com/docs/aura/platform/api/authentication/#_creating_credentials[Aura
API credentialsn].

Using these credentials, we can create our `GdsSessions` object, which
is the main entry point for managing GDS Sessions.

[source, python, role=no-test]
----
import os

from graphdatascience.session import AuraAPICredentials, GdsSessions

client_id = os.environ["AURA_API_CLIENT_ID"]
client_secret = os.environ["AURA_API_CLIENT_SECRET"]

# If your account is a member of several tenants, you must also specify the tenant ID to use
tenant_id = os.environ.get("AURA_API_TENANT_ID", None)

sessions = GdsSessions(api_credentials=AuraAPICredentials(client_id, client_secret, tenant_id=tenant_id))
----

== Creating a new session

A new session is created by calling `sessions.get++_++or++_++create()`.
As the data source, we assume that a self-managed Neo4j DBMS instance
has been set up and is accessible. We need to pass the database address,
user name and password to the `DbmsConnectionInfo` class.

We also need to specify the session size. Please refer to the API
reference documentation or the manual for a full list.

Finally, we need to give our session a name. We will call ours
`people-and-fruits-sm'. It is possible to reconnect to an existing session by calling`get++_++or++_++create++`++
with the same session name and configuration.

We will also set a time-to-live (TTL) for the session. This ensures that
our session is automatically deleted after being unused for 5 hours.
This is a good practice to avoid incurring costs should we forget to
delete the session ourselves.

[source, python, role=no-test]
----
from graphdatascience.session import AlgorithmCategory

# Estimate the memory needed for the GDS session
memory = sessions.estimate(
    node_count=20,
    relationship_count=50,
    algorithm_categories=[AlgorithmCategory.CENTRALITY, AlgorithmCategory.NODE_EMBEDDING],
)

# Find out and specify where to create the GDS session
cloud_locations = sessions.available_cloud_locations()
print(f"Available locations: {cloud_locations}")
cloud_location = cloud_locations[0]
----

[source, python, role=no-test]
----
import os
from datetime import timedelta

from graphdatascience.session import DbmsConnectionInfo

# Identify the Neo4j DBMS
db_connection = DbmsConnectionInfo(
    uri=os.environ["NEO4J_URI"], username=os.environ["NEO4J_USER"], password=os.environ["NEO4J_PASSWORD"]
)

# Create a GDS session!
gds = sessions.get_or_create(
    # we give it a representative name
    session_name="people-and-fruits-sm",
    memory=memory,
    db_connection=db_connection,
    ttl=timedelta(hours=5),
    cloud_location=cloud_location,
)
----

== Listing sessions

Now that we have created a session, let’s list all our sessions to see
what that looks like

[source, python, role=no-test]
----
from pandas import DataFrame

gds_sessions = sessions.list()

# for better visualization
DataFrame(gds_sessions)
----

== Adding a dataset

We assume that the configured Neo4j database instance is empty. We will
add our dataset using standard Cypher.

In a more realistic scenario, this step is already done, and we would
just connect to the existing database.

[source, python, role=no-test]
----
data_query = """
  CREATE
    (dan:Person {name: 'Dan',     age: 18, experience: 63, hipster: 0}),
    (annie:Person {name: 'Annie', age: 12, experience: 5, hipster: 0}),
    (matt:Person {name: 'Matt',   age: 22, experience: 42, hipster: 0}),
    (jeff:Person {name: 'Jeff',   age: 51, experience: 12, hipster: 0}),
    (brie:Person {name: 'Brie',   age: 31, experience: 6, hipster: 0}),
    (elsa:Person {name: 'Elsa',   age: 65, experience: 23, hipster: 1}),
    (john:Person {name: 'John',   age: 4, experience: 100, hipster: 0}),

    (apple:Fruit {name: 'Apple',   tropical: 0, sourness: 0.3, sweetness: 0.6}),
    (banana:Fruit {name: 'Banana', tropical: 1, sourness: 0.1, sweetness: 0.9}),
    (mango:Fruit {name: 'Mango',   tropical: 1, sourness: 0.3, sweetness: 1.0}),
    (plum:Fruit {name: 'Plum',     tropical: 0, sourness: 0.5, sweetness: 0.8})

  CREATE
    (dan)-[:LIKES]->(apple),
    (annie)-[:LIKES]->(banana),
    (matt)-[:LIKES]->(mango),
    (jeff)-[:LIKES]->(mango),
    (brie)-[:LIKES]->(banana),
    (elsa)-[:LIKES]->(plum),
    (john)-[:LIKES]->(plum),

    (dan)-[:KNOWS]->(annie),
    (dan)-[:KNOWS]->(matt),
    (annie)-[:KNOWS]->(matt),
    (annie)-[:KNOWS]->(jeff),
    (annie)-[:KNOWS]->(brie),
    (matt)-[:KNOWS]->(brie),
    (brie)-[:KNOWS]->(elsa),
    (brie)-[:KNOWS]->(jeff),
    (john)-[:KNOWS]->(jeff);
"""

# making sure the database is actually empty
assert gds.run_cypher("MATCH (n) RETURN count(n)").squeeze() == 0, "Database is not empty!"

# let's now write our graph!
gds.run_cypher(data_query)

gds.run_cypher("MATCH (n) RETURN count(n) AS nodeCount")
----

== Projecting Graphs

Now that we have imported a graph to our database, we can project it
into our GDS Session. We do that by using the `gds.graph.project()`
endpoint.

The remote projection query that we are using selects all `Person` nodes
and their `LIKES` relationships, and all `Fruit` nodes and their `LIKES`
relationships. Additionally, we project node properties for illustrative
purposes. We can use these node properties as input to algorithms,
although we do not do that in this notebook.

[source, python, role=no-test]
----
G, result = gds.graph.project(
    "people-and-fruits",
    """
    CALL {
        MATCH (p1:Person)
        OPTIONAL MATCH (p1)-[r:KNOWS]->(p2:Person)
        RETURN
          p1 AS source, r AS rel, p2 AS target,
          p1 {.age, .experience, .hipster } AS sourceNodeProperties,
          p2 {.age, .experience, .hipster } AS targetNodeProperties
        UNION
        MATCH (f:Fruit)
        OPTIONAL MATCH (f)<-[r:LIKES]-(p:Person)
        RETURN
          p AS source, r AS rel, f AS target,
          p {.age, .experience, .hipster } AS sourceNodeProperties,
          f { .tropical, .sourness, .sweetness } AS targetNodeProperties
    }
    RETURN gds.graph.project.remote(source, target, {
      sourceNodeProperties: sourceNodeProperties,
      targetNodeProperties: targetNodeProperties,
      sourceNodeLabels: labels(source),
      targetNodeLabels: labels(target),
      relationshipType: type(rel)
    })
    """,
)

str(G)
----

== Running Algorithms

We can now run algorithms on the projected graph. This is done using the
standard GDS Python Client API. There are many other tutorials covering
some interesting things we can do at this step, so we will keep it
rather brief here.

We will simply run PageRank and FastRP on the graph.

[source, python, role=no-test]
----
print("Running PageRank ...")
pr_result = gds.pageRank.mutate(G, mutateProperty="pagerank")
print(f"Compute millis: {pr_result['computeMillis']}")
print(f"Node properties written: {pr_result['nodePropertiesWritten']}")
print(f"Centrality distribution: {pr_result['centralityDistribution']}")

print("Running FastRP ...")
frp_result = gds.fastRP.mutate(
    G,
    mutateProperty="fastRP",
    embeddingDimension=8,
    featureProperties=["pagerank"],
    propertyRatio=0.2,
    nodeSelfInfluence=0.2,
)
print(f"Compute millis: {frp_result['computeMillis']}")
# stream back the results
gds.graph.nodeProperties.stream(G, ["pagerank", "fastRP"], separate_property_columns=True, db_node_properties=["name"])
----

== Writing back to Neo4j

The GDS Session’s in-memory graph was projected from data in our
specified Neo4j database. Write back operations will thus persist the
data back to the same Neo4j database. Let’s write back the results of
the PageRank and FastRP algorithms to the Neo4j database.

[source, python, role=no-test]
----
# if this fails once with some error like "unable to retrieve routing table"
# then run it again. this is a transient error with a stale server cache.
gds.graph.nodeProperties.write(G, ["pagerank", "fastRP"])
----

Of course, we can just use `.write` modes as well. Let’s run Louvain in
write mode to show:

[source, python, role=no-test]
----
gds.louvain.write(G, writeProperty="louvain")
----

We can now use the `gds.run++_++cypher()` method to query the updated
graph. Note that the `run++_++cypher()` method will run the query on the
Neo4j database.

[source, python, role=no-test]
----
gds.run_cypher(
    """
    MATCH (p:Person)
    RETURN p.name, p.pagerank AS rank, p.louvain
     ORDER BY rank DESC
    """
)
----

== Deleting the session

Now that we have finished our analysis, we can delete the session. The
results that we produced were written back to our Neo4j database, and
will not be lost. If we computed additional things that we did not write
back, those will be lost.

Deleting the session will release all resources associated with it, and
stop incurring costs.

[source, python, role=no-test]
----
gds.delete()

# or sessions.delete(session_name="people-and-fruits")
----

[source, python, role=no-test]
----
# let's also make sure the deleted session is truly gone:
sessions.list()
----

[source, python, role=no-test]
----
# Lastly, let's clean up the database
gds.run_cypher("MATCH (n:Person|Fruit) DETACH DELETE n")
----

== Conclusion

And we’re done! We have created a GDS Session, projected a graph, run
some algorithms, written back the results, and deleted the session. This
is a simple example, but it shows the main steps of using GDS Sessions.
