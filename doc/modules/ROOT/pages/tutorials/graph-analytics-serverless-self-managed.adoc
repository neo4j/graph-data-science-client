= Aura Graph Analytics for Self-Managed Neo4j DB


https://colab.research.google.com/github/neo4j/graph-data-science-client/blob/main/examples/graph-analytics-serverless-self-managed.ipynb[image:https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg[Open
In Colab]]


This Jupyter notebook is hosted
https://github.com/neo4j/graph-data-science-client/blob/main/examples/graph-analytics-serverless-self-managed.ipynb[here]
in the Neo4j Graph Data Science Client Github repository.

The notebook shows how to use the `graphdatascience` Python library to
create, manage, and use a GDS Session.

We consider a graph of people and fruits, which we’re using as a simple
example to show how to connect your self-managed Neo4j database to a GDS
Session, run algorithms, and eventually write back your analytical
results to your Neo4j database. We will cover all management operations:
creation, listing, and deletion.

If you are using AuraDB, follow link:../graph-analytics-serverless[this
example].

== Prerequisites

This notebook requires having a Neo4j instance available and that the
Aura Graph Analytics
https://neo4j.com/docs/aura/graph-analytics/#aura-gds-serverless[feature]
is enabled for your Neo4j Aura project.

You also need to have the `graphdatascience` Python library installed,
version `1.15` or later.

[source, python, role=no-test]
----
%pip install "graphdatascience>=1.15" python-dotenv "neo4j_viz[gds]"
----

[source, python, role=no-test]
----
from dotenv import load_dotenv

# This allows to load required secrets from `.env` file in local directory
# This can include Aura API Credentials. If file does not exist this is a noop.
load_dotenv(".env")
----

== Aura API credentials

The entry point for managing GDS Sessions is the `GdsSessions` object,
which requires creating
https://neo4j.com/docs/aura/api/authentication[Aura API credentials].

[source, python, role=no-test]
----
import os

from graphdatascience.session import AuraAPICredentials, GdsSessions

# you can also use AuraAPICredentials.from_env() to load credentials from environment variables
api_credentials = AuraAPICredentials(
    client_id=os.environ["CLIENT_ID"],
    client_secret=os.environ["CLIENT_SECRET"],
    # If your account is a member of several project, you must also specify the project ID to use
    project_id=os.environ.get("PROJECT_ID", None),
)

sessions = GdsSessions(api_credentials=api_credentials)
----

== Creating a new session

A new session is created by calling `sessions.get++_++or++_++create()`
with the following parameters:

* A session name, which lets you reconnect to an existing session by
calling `get++_++or++_++create` again.
* The `DbmsConnectionInfo` containing the address, user name and
password for an accessible self-manged Neo4j DBMS instance
* The session memory.
* The cloud location.
* A time-to-live (TTL), which ensures that the session is automatically
deleted after being unused for the set time, to avoid incurring costs.

See the API reference
https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science-client/current/api/sessions/gds_sessions/#graphdatascience.session.gds_sessions.GdsSessions.get_or_create[documentation]
or the manual for more details on the parameters.

[source, python, role=no-test]

from graphdatascience.session import AlgorithmCategory, CloudLocation, SessionMemory

# Estimate the memory needed for the GDS session
memory = sessions.estimate(
    node_count=20,
    relationship_count=50,
    algorithm_categories=[AlgorithmCategory.CENTRALITY, AlgorithmCategory.NODE_EMBEDDING],
)

# Explicitly define the size of the session
memory = SessionMemory.m_2GB

print(f"Estimated memory: {memory}")

# Specify your cloud location
cloud_location = CloudLocation("gcp", "europe-west1")

# You can find available cloud locations by calling
cloud_locations = sessions.available_cloud_locations()
print(f"Available locations: {cloud_locations}")

import os
from datetime import timedelta

from graphdatascience.session import DbmsConnectionInfo

# Identify the AuraDB instance
# you can also use DbmsConnectionInfo.from_env() to load credentials from environment variables
db_connection = DbmsConnectionInfo(
    uri=os.environ["NEO4J_URI"],
    username=os.environ["NEO4J_USERNAME"],
    password=os.environ["NEO4J_PASSWORD"],
)

# Create a GDS session!
gds = sessions.get_or_create(
    # give it a representative name
    session_name="people-and-fruits-sm",
    memory=memory,
    db_connection=db_connection,
    ttl=timedelta(minutes=30),
    cloud_location=cloud_location,
)
----

== Listing sessions

You can use `sessions.list()` to see the details for each created
session.

[source, python, role=no-test]
----
from pandas import DataFrame

gds_sessions = sessions.list()

# for better visualization
DataFrame(gds_sessions)
----

== Adding a dataset

We assume that the configured Neo4j database instance is empty. You will
add the dataset using standard Cypher.

In a more realistic scenario, this step is already done, and you would
just connect to the existing database.

[source, python, role=no-test]
----
data_query = """
  CREATE
    (dan:Person {name: 'Dan',     age: 18, experience: 63, hipster: 0}),
    (annie:Person {name: 'Annie', age: 12, experience: 5, hipster: 0}),
    (matt:Person {name: 'Matt',   age: 22, experience: 42, hipster: 0}),
    (jeff:Person {name: 'Jeff',   age: 51, experience: 12, hipster: 0}),

    (apple:Fruit {name: 'Apple',   tropical: 0, sourness: 0.3, sweetness: 0.6}),
    (banana:Fruit {name: 'Banana', tropical: 1, sourness: 0.1, sweetness: 0.9}),
    (mango:Fruit {name: 'Mango',   tropical: 1, sourness: 0.3, sweetness: 1.0}),
    (plum:Fruit {name: 'Plum',     tropical: 0, sourness: 0.5, sweetness: 0.8})

    (john)-[:KNOWS]->(jeff);
"""

# making sure the database is actually empty
assert gds.run_cypher("MATCH (n) RETURN count(n)").squeeze() == 0, "Database is not empty!"

# let's now write our graph!
gds.run_cypher(data_query)

gds.run_cypher("MATCH (n) RETURN count(n) AS nodeCount")
----

== Projecting Graphs

Now that you have imported a graph to the database, you can project it
into our GDS Session. You do that by using the `gds.graph.project()`
endpoint.

The remote projection query that you are using selects all `Person`
nodes and their `LIKES` relationships, and all `Fruit` nodes and their
`LIKES` relationships. Additionally, node properties are projected for
illustrative purposes. You can use these node properties as input to
algorithms, although it is note done in this notebook.

[source, python, role=no-test]
----
G, result = gds.graph.project(
    "people-and-fruits",
    """
    CALL () {
        MATCH (p1:Person)
        OPTIONAL MATCH (p1)-[r:KNOWS]->(p2:Person)
        RETURN
          p1 AS source, r AS rel, p2 AS target,
          p1 {.age, .experience, .hipster } AS sourceNodeProperties,
          p2 {.age, .experience, .hipster } AS targetNodeProperties
        UNION
        MATCH (f:Fruit)
        OPTIONAL MATCH (f)<-[r:LIKES]-(p:Person)
        RETURN
          p AS source, r AS rel, f AS target,
          p {.age, .experience, .hipster } AS sourceNodeProperties,
          f { .tropical, .sourness, .sweetness } AS targetNodeProperties
    }
    RETURN gds.graph.project.remote(source, target, {
      sourceNodeProperties: sourceNodeProperties,
      targetNodeProperties: targetNodeProperties,
      sourceNodeLabels: labels(source),
      targetNodeLabels: labels(target),
      relationshipType: type(rel)
    })
    """,
)

str(G)
----

[source, python, role=no-test]
----
# Let us visualize the projected graph
from neo4j_viz.gds import from_gds

VG = from_gds(gds, G, db_node_properties=["name"])
for node in VG.nodes:
    node.caption = node.properties.get("name")

VG.render(initial_zoom=1.2)
----

== Running Algorithms

You can run algorithms on the constructed graph using the standard GDS
Python Client API. See the other tutorials for more examples.

[source, python, role=no-test]
----
print("Running PageRank ...")
pr_result = gds.pageRank.mutate(G, mutateProperty="pagerank")
print(f"Compute millis: {pr_result['computeMillis']}")
print(f"Node properties written: {pr_result['nodePropertiesWritten']}")
print(f"Centrality distribution: {pr_result['centralityDistribution']}")

print("Running FastRP ...")
frp_result = gds.fastRP.mutate(
    G,
    mutateProperty="fastRP",
    embeddingDimension=8,
    featureProperties=["pagerank"],
    propertyRatio=0.2,
    nodeSelfInfluence=0.2,
)
print(f"Compute millis: {frp_result['computeMillis']}")
# stream back the results
gds.graph.nodeProperties.stream(G, ["pagerank", "fastRP"], separate_property_columns=True, db_node_properties=["name"])
----

== Writing back to Neo4j

The GDS Session’s in-memory graph was projected from data in our
specified Neo4j database. Write back operations will thus persist the
data back to the same Neo4j database. Let’s write back the results of
the PageRank and FastRP algorithms to the Neo4j database.

[source, python, role=no-test]
----
# if this fails once with some error like "unable to retrieve routing table"
# then run it again. this is a transient error with a stale server cache.
gds.graph.nodeProperties.write(G, ["pagerank", "fastRP"])
----

Of course, you can just use `.write` modes as well. Let’s run Louvain in
write mode to show:

[source, python, role=no-test]
----
gds.louvain.write(G, writeProperty="louvain")
----

You can now use the `gds.run++_++cypher()` method to query the updated
graph. Note that the `run++_++cypher()` method will run the query on the
Neo4j database.

[source, python, role=no-test]
----
gds.run_cypher(
    """
    MATCH (p:Person)
    RETURN p.name, p.pagerank AS rank, p.louvain
     ORDER BY rank DESC
    """
)
----

== Deleting the session

Now that you have finished the analysis, you can delete the session. The
results that you produced were written back to our Neo4j database, and
will not be lost. If you computed additional things that you did not
write back, those will be lost.

Deleting the session will release all resources associated with it, and
stop incurring costs.

[source, python, role=no-test]
----
# or gds.delete()
sessions.delete(session_name="people-and-fruits-sm")
----

[source, python, role=no-test]
----
# let's also make sure the deleted session is truly gone:
sessions.list()
----

[source, python, role=no-test]
----
# Lastly, let's clean up the database
gds.run_cypher("MATCH (n:Person|Fruit) DETACH DELETE n")
----
