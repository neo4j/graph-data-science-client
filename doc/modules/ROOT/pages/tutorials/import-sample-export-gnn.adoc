In Colab]]


This notebook exemplifies how to use the `graphdatascience` and PyTorch
Geometric (PyG) Python libraries to:

* Import the https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/cora[CORA dataset]
directly into GDS
* Sample a part of CORA using the
https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/management-ops/projections/rwr/[GDS
Random walk with restarts algorithm]
* Export the CORA sample client side
* Define and train a Graph Convolutional Neural Network (GCN) on the
CORA sample
* Evaluate the GCN on a test set

== Prerequisites

Running this notebook requires a Neo4j server with a recent GDS version
(2.2+) installed. We recommend using Neo4j Desktop with GDS, or AuraDS.

Also required are of course the Python libraries:

* `graphdatascience` (see
https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science-client/current/installation/[docs]
for installation instructions)
* PyG (see
https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notes/installation.html[PyG
docs] for installation instructions)

== Setup

We start by importing our dependencies and setting up our GDS client
connection to the database.

[source, python, role=no-test]
----
# Install necessary dependencies
%pip install torch torch_scatter torch_sparse torch_geometric graphdatascience
----

[source, python, role=no-test]
----
import os
import pandas as pd
from graphdatascience import GraphDataScience
import torch
from torch_geometric.data import Data
import torch.nn.functional as F
from torch_geometric.nn import GCNConv
from torch_geometric.transforms import RandomNodeSplit
import random
import numpy as np

----
# Set seeds for consistent results

np.random.seed(42)

----

[source, python, role=no-test]
----
# Get Neo4j DB URI, credentials and name from environment if applicable
NEO4J_URI = os.environ.get("NEO4J_URI", "bolt://localhost:7687")
NEO4J_AUTH = None
NEO4J_DB = os.environ.get("NEO4J_DB", "neo4j")
if os.environ.get("NEO4J_USER") and os.environ.get("NEO4J_PASSWORD"):
    NEO4J_AUTH = (
        os.environ.get("NEO4J_USER"),
        os.environ.get("NEO4J_PASSWORD"),
    )
gds = GraphDataScience(NEO4J_URI, auth=NEO4J_AUTH, database=NEO4J_DB)
----

== Sampling CORA

Next we use the built-in CORA loader to get the data into GDS. We will
then sample it to get a smaller graph to train on. In a real world
scenario, we would probably project data from a Neo4j database into GDS
instead.

[source, python, role=no-test]
----
G = gds.graph.load_cora()
----

[source, python, role=no-test]
----
# Let's make sure we constructed the correct graph
print(f"Metadata for our loaded Cora graph `G`: {G}")
print(f"Node labels present in `G`: {G.node_labels()}")
----

It’s looks correct! Now let’s go ahead and sample the graph.

[source, python, role=no-test]
----
# We use the random walk with restarts sampling algorithm with default values
G_sample, _ = gds.alpha.graph.sample.rwr("cora_sample", G, randomSeed=42, concurrency=1)
----

[source, python, role=no-test]
----
# We should have somewhere around 0.15 * 2708 ~ 406 nodes in our sample
print(f"Number of nodes in our sample: {G_sample.node_count()}")

# And let's see how many relationships we got
print(f"Number of relationships in our sample: {G_sample.relationship_count()}")
----

== Exporting sampled CORA

We can now export the topology and node properties of the sampled graph
that we need to train our model.

[source, python, role=no-test]
----
# Get the relationship data from our sample
sample_topology_df = gds.beta.graph.relationships.stream(G_sample)
----

[source, python, role=no-test]
----
# Let's see what we got:
display(sample_topology_df)
----

We get the right amount of rows, one for each expected relationship.
However, the node IDs are rather large whereas PyG expects consecutive
IDs starting from zero. We now will start to massage our data structure
containing the relationships until PyG can use it.

[source, python, role=no-test]
----
# By using `by_rel_type` we get the topology in a format that can be used as input to several GNN frameworks:
# {"rel_type": [[source_nodes], [target_nodes]]}

sample_topology = sample_topology_df.by_rel_type()
----

[source, python, role=no-test]
----
# We should only have the "CITES" keys since there's only one relationship type
print(f"Relationship type keys: {sample_topology.keys()}")
print(f"Number of  {len(sample_topology['CITES'])}")

# How many source nodes do we have?
print(len(sample_topology["CITES"][0]))
----

Great, it looks like we have the format we need to create a PyG
`edge_index` later.

[source, python, role=no-test]
----
# We also need to export the node properties corresponding to our node labels and features, represented by the
# "subject" and "features" node properties respectively
sample_node_properties = gds.graph.nodeProperties.stream(
    G_sample,
    ["subject", "features"],
    separate_property_columns=True,
)
----

[source, python, role=no-test]
----
# Let's make sure we got the data we expected
display(sample_node_properties)
----

== Constructing GCN input

Now that we have all information we need client side, we can construct
the PyG `Data` object we will use as training input. We will remap the
node IDs to be consecutive and starting from zero. We use the ordering
of node ids in `sample_node_properties` as our remapping so that the
index is aligned with the node properties.

[source, python, role=no-test]
----
# In order for the node ids used in the `topology` to be consecutive and starting from zero,
# we will need to remap them. This way they will also align with the row numbering of the
# `sample_node_properties` data frame
def normalize_topology_index(new_idx_to_old, topology):
    # Create a reverse mapping based on new idx -> old idx
    old_idx_to_new = dict((v, k) for k, v in new_idx_to_old.items())
    return [[old_idx_to_new[node_id] for node_id in nodes] for nodes in topology]


# We use the ordering of node ids in `sample_node_properties` as our remapping
# The result is: [[mapped_source_nodes], [mapped_target_nodes]]
normalized_topology = normalize_topology_index(dict(sample_node_properties["nodeId"]), sample_topology["CITES"])
----

[source, python, role=no-test]
----
# We use the ordering of node ids in `sample_node_properties` as our remapping
edge_index = torch.tensor(normalized_topology, dtype=torch.long)

# We specify the node property "features" as the zero-layer node embeddings
x = torch.tensor(sample_node_properties["features"], dtype=torch.float)

# We specify the node property "subject" as class labels
y = torch.tensor(sample_node_properties["subject"], dtype=torch.long)

data = Data(x=x, y=y, edge_index=edge_index)

print(data)
----

[source, python, role=no-test]
----
# Do a random split of the data so that ~10% goes into a test set and the rest used for training
transform = RandomNodeSplit(num_test=40, num_val=0)
_ = transform(data)

# We can see that our `data` object have been extended with some masks defining the split
print(data)
print(data.train_mask.sum().item())
----

As a sidenote, if we had wanted to do some hyperarameter tuning, it
would have been useful to keep some data for a validation set as well.

== Training and evaluating a GCN

Let’s now define and train the GCN using PyG and our sampled CORA as
input. We adapt the CORA GCN example from the
https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notes/introduction.html#learning-methods-on-graphs[PyG
documentation].

In this example we evaluate the model on a test set of the sampled CORA.
Please note however, that since GCN is an inductive algorithm we could
also have evaluated it on the full CORA dataset, or even another
(similar) graph for that matter.

[source, python, role=no-test]
----
num_classes = y.unique().shape[0]

# Define the GCN architecture
class GCN(torch.nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.conv1 = GCNConv(data.num_node_features, 16)
        self.conv2 = GCNConv(16, num_classes)

    def forward(self, data):
        x, edge_index = data.x, data.edge_index

        x = self.conv1(x, edge_index)
        x = F.relu(x)
        x = F.dropout(x, training=self.training)
        x = self.conv2(x, edge_index)

        # We use log_softmax and nll_loss instead of softmax output and cross entropy loss
        # for reasons for performance and numerical stability.
        # They are mathematically equivalent
        return F.log_softmax(x, dim=1)
----

[source, python, role=no-test]
----
# Prepare training by setting up for the chosen device
device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")

# Let's see what device was chosen
print(device)
----

[source, python, role=no-test]
----
# In standard PyTorch fashion we instantiate our model, and transfer it to the memory of the chosen device
model = GCN().to(device)

# Let's inspect our model architecture
print(model)

# Pass our input data to the chosen device too
data = data.to(device)

# Since hyperparameter tuning is out of scope for this small example, we initialize an
# Adam optimizer with some fixed learning rate and weight decay
optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.01, weight_decay=5e-4)
----

From inspecting the model we can see that that the output size is 7,
which looks correct since Cora does indeed have 7 different paper
subjects.

[source, python, role=no-test]
----
# Train the GCN using the CORA sample represented by `data` using the standard PyTorch training loop
model.train()
for epoch in range(200):
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    out = model(data)
    loss = F.nll_loss(out[data.train_mask], data.y[data.train_mask])
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
----

[source, python, role=no-test]
----
# Evaluate the trained GCN model on our test set
model.eval()
pred = model(data).argmax(dim=1)
correct = (pred[data.test_mask] == data.y[data.test_mask]).sum()
acc = int(correct) / int(data.test_mask.sum())

print(f"Accuracy: {acc:.4f}")
----

The accuracy looks good. The next step would be to run the GCN model we
trained our subsample on the entire Cora graph. This part is left as an
exercise.

== Cleanup

We remove the CORA graphs from the GDS graph catalog.

[source, python, role=no-test]

_ = G_sample.drop()
_ = G.drop()
