This Jupyter notebook is hosted
https://github.com/neo4j/graph-data-science-client/blob/main/examples/centrality-algorithms.ipynb[here]
in the Neo4j Graph Data Science Client Github repository.

Centrality algorithms are used to understand the role or influence of
particular nodes in a graph. The notebook shows the application of
centrality algorithms using the `graphdatascience` library on the
Airline travel reachability network dataset that can be downloaded
https://snap.stanford.edu/data/reachability.html[here].

This notebook will show how you can apply eigenvector centrality,
betweenness centrality, degree centrality and closeness centrality on a
graph dataset.

== Setup

We start by importing our dependencies and setting up our GDS client
connection to the database.

[source, python, role=no-test]
----
# Install necessary dependencies
%pip install graphdatascience pandas
----

[source, python, role=no-test]
----
from graphdatascience import GraphDataScience
import pandas as pd
import os
----

[source, python, role=no-test]
----
NEO4J_URI = os.environ.get("NEO4J_URI", "bolt://localhost:7687")
NEO4J_AUTH = None
if os.environ.get("NEO4J_USER") and os.environ.get("NEO4J_PASSWORD"):
    NEO4J_AUTH = (
        os.environ.get("NEO4J_USER"),
        os.environ.get("NEO4J_PASSWORD"),
    )

gds = GraphDataScience(NEO4J_URI, auth=NEO4J_AUTH)
----

== Importing the dataset

We import the dataset as a pandas dataframe first. We deal with two
files here. The file `reachability-meta.csv.gz` stores the names of the
cities and their information while the file `reachability.txt.gz` stores
the edges of the graph. An edge exists from city `i` to city `j` if the
estimated airline travel time is less than a threshold.

[source, python, role=no-test]
----
nodes_info_df = pd.read_csv("https://snap.stanford.edu/data/reachability-meta.csv.gz", compression="gzip")
nodes_info_df.head()
----

[source, python, role=no-test]
----
routes_df = pd.read_csv(
    "https://snap.stanford.edu/data/reachability.txt.gz",
    sep=" ",
    skiprows=6,
    header=None,
    compression="gzip",
    names=["Origin", "Destination", "Weight"],
)
routes_df.head()
----

Since this graph is very small, a straight-forward Cypher `UNWIND` query
is the simplest way to create our graph in the database.

Larger graphs may need a more sophisticated importing technique like
batching, `neo4j-admin import` or Arrow `CREATE DATABASE`.

[source, python, role=no-test]
----
gds.run_cypher(
    "UNWIND $nodes AS node CREATE (n:City {node_id: node.node_id, name: node.name, population: node.metro_pop})",
    params={"nodes": nodes_info_df.to_dict("records")},
)

gds.run_cypher(
    """
    UNWIND $rels AS rel 
    MATCH (source:City {node_id: rel.Origin}), (target:City {node_id: rel.Destination}) 
    CREATE (source)-[:HAS_FLIGHT_TO]->(target)
    """,
    params={"rels": routes_df.to_dict("records")},
)
----

[source, python, role=no-test]
----
G, result = gds.graph.project("airline", "City", "HAS_FLIGHT_TO")

print(f"The projection took {result['projectMillis']} ms")

# We can use convenience methods on `G` to check if the projection looks correct
print(f"Graph '{G.name()}' node count: {G.node_count()}")
print(f"Graph '{G.name()}' node labels: {G.node_labels()}")
print(f"Graph '{G.name()}' relationship count: {G.relationship_count()}")
----

== Eigenvector Centrality

https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/algorithms/eigenvector-centrality/[Eigenvector
centrality] measures the importance or influence of a node based on its
connections to other nodes in the network. A higher eigenvector
centrality score suggests that a node is more central and influential
within the network.

For our dataset, eigenvector centrality can help identify airports that
are not only well-connected themselves but also have connections to
other important airports. Nodes with high eigenvector centrality are
likely to be major hubs or airports with extensive connectivity.

[source, python, role=no-test]
----
eigenvector_centrality_result = gds.eigenvector.mutate(G, maxIterations=100, mutateProperty="eigenvectorCentrality")
----

[source, python, role=no-test]
----
# We can verify that the eigenvectorCentrality was mutated
G.node_properties()
----

We can see if our implementation converged or not and if converged, the
number of iterations it took using the below code:

[source, python, role=no-test]
----
if eigenvector_centrality_result.didConverge:
    print(
        f"The number of iterations taken by Eigenvector Centrality to run is {eigenvector_centrality_result.ranIterations}."
    )
else:
    print("Algorithm did not converge!")
----

We can also see the distribution of the eigenvector centrality measures
using the below code. This will show us the minimum, maximum, mean and
other statistical values for our centrality measure.

[source, python, role=no-test]
----
eigenvector_centrality_result.centralityDistribution
----

We will now write our results back to the database.

[source, python, role=no-test]
----
gds.graph.nodeProperties.write(G, ["eigenvectorCentrality"])
----

Using the results from eigenvector centrality, we can now look up the
top 20 cities with airports that have major hubs or airports with
extensive connectivity.

[source, python, role=no-test]
----
def display_top_20_cities(centrality_measure):
    """
    Function to execute the Cypher query to retrieve the top 20 cities with the highest centrality measure.
    """
    query = f"""
    MATCH (n:City)
    RETURN n.node_id AS node_id, n.name AS name, n.population AS population, n.{centrality_measure} AS {centrality_measure}
    ORDER BY n.{centrality_measure} DESC
    LIMIT 20
    """
    result = gds.run_cypher(query)

    # Display the result
    print(result)


display_top_20_cities("eigenvectorCentrality")

== Betweenness Centrality

https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/algorithms/betweenness-centrality/[Betweenness
Centrality] quantifies the importance of a node as a bridge or
intermediary in the network. It measures how often a node lies on the
shortest path between other pairs of nodes.

For our dataset, cities/airports with high betweenness centrality serve
as crucial transfer points or connecting hubs between airports that
might not have direct flights between them. They play a significant role
in facilitating the flow of air travel and can be vital for overall
network connectivity.

[source, python, role=no-test]
----
betweenness_centrality_result = gds.betweenness.mutate(G, mutateProperty="betweennessCentrality")
----

[source, python, role=no-test]
----
# We can verify that the betweennessCentrality was mutated
G.node_properties()
----

We can also see the distribution of the betweenness centrality measures
using the below code. This will show us the minimum, maximum, mean and
other statistical values for our centrality measure.

[source, python, role=no-test]
----
betweenness_centrality_result.centralityDistribution
----

We will now write our results back to the database.

[source, python, role=no-test]
----
gds.graph.nodeProperties.write(G, ["betweennessCentrality"])
----

Using the results from betweenness centrality, we can now look up the
top 20 cities with airports that serve as crucial transfer points or
connecting hubs between airports that might not have direct flights
between them.

[source, python, role=no-test]
----
display_top_20_cities("betweennessCentrality")
----

== Degree Centrality

https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/algorithms/degree-centrality/[Degree
Centrality] measures the number of connections (edges) a node has in the
network.

For our dataset, cities with high degree centrality have a large number
of direct flight connections to other cities. They represent cities that
have many direct destinations or are frequently used for direct travel.
Degree centrality provides insights into the prominence and connectivity
of individual airports within the network.

[source, python, role=no-test]
----
degree_centrality_result = gds.degree.mutate(G, mutateProperty="degreeCentrality")
----

[source, python, role=no-test]
----
# We can verify that the degreeCentrality was mutated
G.node_properties()
----

Similar to above, we can also see the distribution of the degree
centrality measures using the below code. This will show us the minimum,
maximum, mean and other statistical values for our centrality measure.

[source, python, role=no-test]
----
degree_centrality_result.centralityDistribution
----

We will now write our results back to the database.

[source, python, role=no-test]
----
gds.graph.nodeProperties.write(G, ["degreeCentrality"])
----

Finally, using the results from degree centrality, we can now look up
the top 20 cities with airports that have a large number of direct
flights.

[source, python, role=no-test]
----
display_top_20_cities("degreeCentrality")
----

== Cleanup

Before finishing we can clean up the example data from both the GDS
in-memory state and the database.

[source, python, role=no-test]
----
# Cleanup GDS
G.drop()
----

[source, python, role=no-test]
----
# Cleanup database
gds.run_cypher("MATCH (n:City) DETACH DELETE n")
----
