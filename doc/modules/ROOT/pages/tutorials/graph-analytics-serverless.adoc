In Colab]]


This Jupyter notebook is hosted
https://github.com/neo4j/graph-data-science-client/blob/main/examples/graph-analytics-serverless.ipynb[here]
in the Neo4j Graph Data Science Client Github repository.

The notebook shows how to use the `graphdatascience` Python library to
create, manage, and use a GDS Session.

We consider a graph of people and fruits, which we’re using as a simple
example to show how to connect your AuraDB instance to a GDS Session,
run algorithms, and eventually write back your analytical results to the
AuraDB database. We will cover all management operations: creation,
listing, and deletion.

If you are using self managed DB, follow
link:../graph-analytics-serverless-self-managed[this example].

== Prerequisites

This notebook requires having an AuraDB instance available and have the
Graph Analytics Serverless
https://neo4j.com/docs/aura/graph-analytics/#aura-gds-serverless[feature]
enabled for your project.

You also need to have the `graphdatascience` Python library installed,
version `1.15` or later.

[source, python, role=no-test]
----
%pip install "graphdatascience>=1.15" python-dotenv
----

[source, python, role=no-test]
----
from dotenv import load_dotenv

# This allows to load required secrets from `.env` file in local directory
# This can include Aura API Credentials and Database Credentials.
# If file does not exist this is a noop.
load_dotenv(".env")
----

== Aura API credentials

The entry point for managing GDS Sessions is the `GdsSessions` object,
which requires creating
https://neo4j.com/docs/aura/api/authentication[Aura API credentials].

[source, python, role=no-test]
----
import os

from graphdatascience.session import AuraAPICredentials, GdsSessions

# If your account is a member of several project, you must also specify the project ID to use

api_credentials = AuraAPICredentials(
    client_id=os.environ["CLIENT_ID"],
    client_secret=os.environ["CLIENT_SECRET"],
    project_id=os.environ.get("PROJECT_ID", None),
)

sessions = GdsSessions(api_credentials=api_credentials)
----

== Creating a new session

A new session is created by calling `sessions.get++_++or++_++create()`
with the following parameters:

* A session name, which lets you reconnect to an existing session by
calling `get++_++or++_++create` again.
* The `DbmsConnectionInfo` containing the address, user name and
password to an AuraDB instance
* The session memory.
* The cloud location.
* A time-to-live (TTL), which ensures that the session is automatically
deleted after being unused for the set time, to avoid incurring costs.

See the API reference
https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science-client/current/api/sessions/gds_sessions/#graphdatascience.session.gds_sessions.GdsSessions.get_or_create[documentation]
or the manual for more details on the parameters.

from graphdatascience.session import AlgorithmCategory, SessionMemory

# Explicitly define the size of the session
memory = SessionMemory.m_8GB

# Estimate the memory needed for the GDS session
memory = sessions.estimate(
    node_count=20,
    relationship_count=50,
    algorithm_categories=[AlgorithmCategory.CENTRALITY, AlgorithmCategory.NODE_EMBEDDING],
)

from datetime import timedelta

from graphdatascience.session import DbmsConnectionInfo

# Identify the AuraDB instance
db_connection = DbmsConnectionInfo(
    uri=os.environ["NEO4J_URI"],
    username=os.environ["NEO4J_USERNAME"],
    password=os.environ["NEO4J_PASSWORD"],
)

# Create a GDS session!
gds = sessions.get_or_create(
    # we give it a representative name
    session_name="people_and_fruits",
    memory=SessionMemory.m_4GB,
    db_connection=db_connection,
    ttl=timedelta(minutes=2),
)
----

== Listing sessions

You can use `sessions.list()` to see the details for each created
session.

[source, python, role=no-test]
----
from pandas import DataFrame

gds_sessions = sessions.list()

# for better visualization
DataFrame(gds_sessions)
----

== Adding a dataset

We assume that the configured AuraDB instance is empty. We will add our
dataset using standard Cypher.

In a more realistic scenario, this step is already done, and we would
just connect to the existing database.

[source, python, role=no-test]
----
data_query = """
  CREATE
    (dan:Person {name: 'Dan',     age: 18, experience: 63, hipster: 0}),
    (annie:Person {name: 'Annie', age: 12, experience: 5, hipster: 0}),
    (matt:Person {name: 'Matt',   age: 22, experience: 42, hipster: 0}),
    (jeff:Person {name: 'Jeff',   age: 51, experience: 12, hipster: 0}),
    (brie:Person {name: 'Brie',   age: 31, experience: 6, hipster: 0}),
    (elsa:Person {name: 'Elsa',   age: 65, experience: 23, hipster: 1}),
    (john:Person {name: 'John',   age: 4, experience: 100, hipster: 0}),

    (apple:Fruit {name: 'Apple',   tropical: 0, sourness: 0.3, sweetness: 0.6}),
    (banana:Fruit {name: 'Banana', tropical: 1, sourness: 0.1, sweetness: 0.9}),
    (mango:Fruit {name: 'Mango',   tropical: 1, sourness: 0.3, sweetness: 1.0}),
    (plum:Fruit {name: 'Plum',     tropical: 0, sourness: 0.5, sweetness: 0.8})

  CREATE
    (dan)-[:LIKES]->(apple),
    (annie)-[:LIKES]->(banana),
    (matt)-[:LIKES]->(mango),
    (jeff)-[:LIKES]->(mango),
    (brie)-[:LIKES]->(banana),
    (elsa)-[:LIKES]->(plum),
    (john)-[:LIKES]->(plum),

    (dan)-[:KNOWS]->(annie),
    (dan)-[:KNOWS]->(matt),
    (annie)-[:KNOWS]->(matt),
    (annie)-[:KNOWS]->(jeff),
    (annie)-[:KNOWS]->(brie),
    (matt)-[:KNOWS]->(brie),
    (brie)-[:KNOWS]->(elsa),
    (brie)-[:KNOWS]->(jeff),
    (john)-[:KNOWS]->(jeff);
"""

# making sure the database is actually empty
assert gds.run_cypher("MATCH (n) RETURN count(n)").squeeze() == 0, "Database is not empty!"

# let's now write our graph!
gds.run_cypher(data_query)

gds.run_cypher("MATCH (n) RETURN count(n) AS nodeCount")
----

== Projecting Graphs

Now that we have imported a graph to our database, we can project it
into our GDS Session. We do that by using the `gds.graph.project()`
endpoint.

The remote projection query that we are using selects all `Person` nodes
and their `LIKES` relationships, and all `Fruit` nodes and their `LIKES`
relationships. Additionally, we project node properties for illustrative
purposes. We can use these node properties as input to algorithms,
although we do not do that in this notebook.

[source, python, role=no-test]
----
G, result = gds.graph.project(
    "people-and-fruits",
    """
    CALL {
        MATCH (p1:Person)
        OPTIONAL MATCH (p1)-[r:KNOWS]->(p2:Person)
        RETURN
          p1 AS source, r AS rel, p2 AS target,
          p1 {.age, .experience, .hipster } AS sourceNodeProperties,
          p2 {.age, .experience, .hipster } AS targetNodeProperties
        UNION
        MATCH (f:Fruit)
        OPTIONAL MATCH (f)<-[r:LIKES]-(p:Person)
        RETURN
          p AS source, r AS rel, f AS target,
          p {.age, .experience, .hipster } AS sourceNodeProperties,
          f { .tropical, .sourness, .sweetness } AS targetNodeProperties
    }
    RETURN gds.graph.project.remote(source, target, {
      sourceNodeProperties: sourceNodeProperties,
      targetNodeProperties: targetNodeProperties,
      sourceNodeLabels: labels(source),
      targetNodeLabels: labels(target),
      relationshipType: type(rel)
    })
    """,
)

str(G)
----

== Running Algorithms

You can run algorithms on the constructed graph using the standard GDS
Python Client API. See the other tutorials for more examples.

[source, python, role=no-test]
----
print("Running PageRank ...")
pr_result = gds.pageRank.mutate(G, mutateProperty="pagerank")
print(f"Compute millis: {pr_result['computeMillis']}")
print(f"Node properties written: {pr_result['nodePropertiesWritten']}")
print(f"Centrality distribution: {pr_result['centralityDistribution']}")

print("Running FastRP ...")
frp_result = gds.fastRP.mutate(
    G,
    mutateProperty="fastRP",
    embeddingDimension=8,
    featureProperties=["pagerank"],
    propertyRatio=0.2,
    nodeSelfInfluence=0.2,
)
print(f"Compute millis: {frp_result['computeMillis']}")
# stream back the results
gds.graph.nodeProperties.stream(G, ["pagerank", "fastRP"], separate_property_columns=True, db_node_properties=["name"])
----

== Writing back to AuraDB

The GDS Session’s in-memory graph was projected from data in our
specified AuraDB instance. Write back operations will thus persist the
data back to the same AuraDB. Let’s write back the results of the
PageRank and FastRP algorithms to the AuraDB instance.

[source, python, role=no-test]
----
# if this fails once with some error like "unable to retrieve routing table"
# then run it again. this is a transient error with a stale server cache.
gds.graph.nodeProperties.write(G, ["pagerank", "fastRP"])
----

Of course, we can just use `.write` modes as well. Let’s run Louvain in
write mode to show:

[source, python, role=no-test]
----
gds.louvain.write(G, writeProperty="louvain")
----

We can now use the `gds.run++_++cypher()` method to query the updated
graph. Note that the `run++_++cypher()` method will run the query on the
AuraDB instance.

[source, python, role=no-test]
----
gds.run_cypher(
    """
    MATCH (p:Person)
    RETURN p.name, p.pagerank AS rank, p.louvain
     ORDER BY rank DESC
    """
)
----

== Deleting the session

Now that we have finished our analysis, we can delete the session. The
results that we produced were written back to our AuraDB instance, and
will not be lost. If we computed additional things that we did not write
back, those will be lost.

Deleting the session will release all resources associated with it, and
stop incurring costs.

[source, python, role=no-test]
----
sessions.delete(session_name="people_and_fruits")

# or gds.delete()
----

[source, python, role=no-test]
----
# let's also make sure the deleted session is truly gone:
sessions.list()
----

[source, python, role=no-test]
----
# Lastly, let's clean up the database
gds.run_cypher("MATCH (n:Person|Fruit) DETACH DELETE n")
----
