This Jupyter notebook is hosted
https://github.com/neo4j/graph-data-science-client/blob/main/examples/graph-analytics-serverless-standalone.ipynb[here]
in the Neo4j Graph Data Science Client Github repository.

The notebook shows how to use the `graphdatascience` Python library to
create, manage, and use a GDS Session.

We consider a graph of people and fruits, which weâ€™re using as a simple
example to show how to load data from Pandas `DataFrame` to a GDS
Session, run algorithms, and inspect the results. We will cover all
management operations: creation, listing, and deletion.

If you are using AuraDB, follow link:../graph-analytics-serverless[this
example]. If you are using a self-managed Neo4j instance, follow
link:../graph-analytics-serverless-self-managed[this example].

== Prerequisites

This notebook requires having the Graph Analytics Serverless
https://neo4j.com/docs/aura/graph-analytics/#aura-gds-serverless[feature]
enabled for your Neo4j Aura project.

You also need to have the `graphdatascience` Python library installed,
version `1.15` or later.

[source, python, role=no-test]
----
%pip install "graphdatascience>=1.15" python-dotenv
----

[source, python, role=no-test]
----
from dotenv import load_dotenv

# This allows to load required secrets from `.env` file in local directory
# This can include Aura API Credentials. If file does not exist this is a noop.
load_dotenv(".env")
----

== Aura API credentials

The entry point for managing GDS Sessions is the `GdsSessions` object,
which requires creating
https://neo4j.com/docs/aura/api/authentication[Aura API credentials].

[source, python, role=no-test]
----
import os

from graphdatascience.session import AuraAPICredentials, GdsSessions

# If your account is a member of several project, you must also specify the project ID to use

api_credentials = AuraAPICredentials(
    client_id=os.environ["CLIENT_ID"],
    client_secret=os.environ["CLIENT_SECRET"],
    project_id=os.environ.get("PROJECT_ID", None),
)

sessions = GdsSessions(api_credentials=api_credentials)
----

== Creating a new session

A new session is created by calling `sessions.get++_++or++_++create()`
with the following parameters:

* A session name, which lets you reconnect to an existing session by
calling `get++_++or++_++create` again.
* The session memory.
* The cloud location.
* A time-to-live (TTL), which ensures that the session is automatically
deleted after being unused for the set time, to avoid incurring costs.

See the API reference
https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science-client/current/api/sessions/gds_sessions/#graphdatascience.session.gds_sessions.GdsSessions.get_or_create[documentation]
or the manual for more details on the parameters.

[source, python, role=no-test]
----
from graphdatascience.session import AlgorithmCategory, CloudLocation, SessionMemory

# Explicitly define the size of the session
memory = SessionMemory.m_4GB

# Estimate the memory needed for the GDS session
memory = sessions.estimate(
    node_count=20,
    relationship_count=50,
    algorithm_categories=[AlgorithmCategory.CENTRALITY, AlgorithmCategory.NODE_EMBEDDING],
)

print(f"Estimated memory: {memory}")

# Specify your cloud location
cloud_location = CloudLocation("gcp", "europe-west1")

# You can find available cloud locations by calling
cloud_locations = sessions.available_cloud_locations()
print(f"Available locations: {cloud_locations}")
----

[source, python, role=no-test]
----
from datetime import timedelta

# Create a GDS session!
gds = sessions.get_or_create(
    # we give it a representative name
    session_name="people-and-fruits-standalone",
    memory=memory,
    ttl=timedelta(minutes=30),
    cloud_location=cloud_location,
)
----

== Listing sessions

You can use `sessions.list()` to see the details for each created
session.

[source, python, role=no-test]
----
from pandas import DataFrame

gds_sessions = sessions.list()

# for better visualization
DataFrame(gds_sessions)
----

== Adding a dataset

We assume that the configured Neo4j database instance is empty. We will
add our dataset using standard Cypher.

In a more realistic scenario, this step is already done, and we would
just connect to the existing database.

[source, python, role=no-test]
----
import pandas as pd

people_df = pd.DataFrame(
    [
        {"nodeId": 0, "name": "Dan", "age": 18, "experience": 63, "hipster": 0},
        {"nodeId": 1, "name": "Annie", "age": 12, "experience": 5, "hipster": 0},
        {"nodeId": 2, "name": "Matt", "age": 22, "experience": 42, "hipster": 0},
        {"nodeId": 3, "name": "Jeff", "age": 51, "experience": 12, "hipster": 0},
        {"nodeId": 4, "name": "Brie", "age": 31, "experience": 6, "hipster": 0},
        {"nodeId": 5, "name": "Elsa", "age": 65, "experience": 23, "hipster": 0},
        {"nodeId": 6, "name": "Bobby", "age": 38, "experience": 4, "hipster": 1},
        {"nodeId": 7, "name": "John", "age": 4, "experience": 100, "hipster": 0},
    ]
)
people_df["labels"] = "Person"

fruits_df = pd.DataFrame(
    [
        {"nodeId": 8, "name": "Apple", "tropical": 0, "sourness": 0.3, "sweetness": 0.6},
        {"nodeId": 9, "name": "Banana", "tropical": 1, "sourness": 0.1, "sweetness": 0.9},
        {"nodeId": 10, "name": "Mango", "tropical": 1, "sourness": 0.3, "sweetness": 1.0},
        {"nodeId": 11, "name": "Plum", "tropical": 0, "sourness": 0.5, "sweetness": 0.8},
    ]
)
fruits_df["labels"] = "Fruit"

like_relationships = [(0, 8), (1, 9), (2, 10), (3, 10), (4, 9), (5, 11), (7, 11)]
likes_df = pd.DataFrame([{"sourceNodeId": src, "targetNodeId": trg} for (src, trg) in like_relationships])
likes_df["relationshipType"] = "LIKES"

knows_relationship = [(0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 5), (7, 3)]
knows_df = pd.DataFrame([{"sourceNodeId": src, "targetNodeId": trg} for (src, trg) in knows_relationship])
knows_df["relationshipType"] = "KNOWS"
----

== Construct Graph from DataFrames

Now that we have imported a graph to our database, we create graphs
directly from pandas `DataFrame` objects. We do that by using the
`gds.graph.construct()` method.

[source, python, role=no-test]
----
# Dropping `name` column as GDS does not support string properties
nodes = [people_df.drop(columns="name"), fruits_df.drop(columns="name")]
relationships = [likes_df, knows_df]

G = gds.graph.construct("people-fruits", nodes, relationships)
str(G)
----

== Running Algorithms

You can run algorithms on the constructed graph using the standard GDS
Python Client API. See the other tutorials for more examples.

[source, python, role=no-test]
----
print("Running PageRank ...")
pr_result = gds.pageRank.mutate(G, mutateProperty="pagerank")
print(f"Compute millis: {pr_result['computeMillis']}")
print(f"Node properties written: {pr_result['nodePropertiesWritten']}")
print(f"Centrality distribution: {pr_result['centralityDistribution']}")

print("Running FastRP ...")
frp_result = gds.fastRP.mutate(
    G,
    mutateProperty="fastRP",
    embeddingDimension=8,
    featureProperties=["pagerank"],
    propertyRatio=0.2,
    nodeSelfInfluence=0.2,
)
print(f"Compute millis: {frp_result['computeMillis']}")
# stream back the results
result = gds.graph.nodeProperties.stream(G, ["pagerank", "fastRP"], separate_property_columns=True)

result
----

To resolve each `nodeId` to name, we can merge it back with the source
data frames.

[source, python, role=no-test]
----
names = pd.concat([people_df, fruits_df])[["nodeId", "name"]]
result.merge(names, how="left")
----

== Deleting the session

After the analysis is done, you can delete the session. As this example
is not connected to a Neo4j DB, you need to make sure the algorithm
results are persisted on your own.

Deleting the session will release all resources associated with it, and
stop incurring costs.

[source, python, role=no-test]
----
# or gds.delete()
sessions.delete(session_name="people-and-fruits-standalone")
----

[source, python, role=no-test]
----
# let's also make sure the deleted session is truly gone:
sessions.list()
----
