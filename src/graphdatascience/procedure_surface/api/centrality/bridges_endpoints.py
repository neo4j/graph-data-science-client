        Executes the Bridges algorithm and returns a stream of results.

        The Bridges algorithm identifies bridge relationships in a graph.
        A bridge is a relationship whose removal increases the number of connected components in the graph.

        Parameters
        ----------
        G
           Graph object to use
        relationship_types
            Filter the graph using the given relationship types. Relationships with any of the given types will be included.
        node_labels
            Filter the graph using the given node labels. Nodes with any of the given labels will be included.
        sudo
            Disable the memory guard.
        log_progress
            Display progress logging.
        username
            As an administrator, impersonate a different user for accessing their graphs.
        concurrency
            Number of concurrent threads to use.
        job_id
            Identifier for the computation.

        Returns
        -------
        DataFrame
            DataFrame with 'from', 'to' and 'remainingSizes' columns. The remainingSizes column contains the sizes of the remaining connected components after removing the bridge relationship.

        Parameters
        ----------
        G
           Graph object to use or a dictionary representing the graph dimensions.
        relationship_types
            Filter the graph using the given relationship types. Relationships with any of the given types will be included.
        node_labels
            Filter the graph using the given node labels. Nodes with any of the given labels will be included.
        concurrency
            Number of concurrent threads to use.
